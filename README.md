## CSC133-Assignment-3
Welcome to Assignment 3 of our project, Snakey Snake! In this assignment, we will work in pairs to enhance a classic Snake game while focusing on utilizing Git for version control and incorporating advanced object-oriented programming concepts such as polymorphism and interfaces.

### Objective:
Our objective is to meet the requirements outlined for the assignment while enhancing the Snake game provided in Chapter 17 of the book "Learning Java by Building Android Games, Second Edition" by Packt Publishing. The main tasks include adding a pause button to the game, changing the game's appearance, and implementing polymorphism and interfaces to elevate the game's structure.

### Requirements:
1. **Git Integration**:
   - Host our project on a Git repository and utilize version control throughout the project.
   - Maintain a clear commit log and include it in our report.
   - Both team members should use the same GitHub Repository.

2. **Polymorphism and Interfaces**:
   - Apply polymorphism and interfaces to improve the structure of the Snake game.
   - Utilize method overloading and overriding to demonstrate static and dynamic polymorphism.
   - Create interfaces representing key functionalities and implement them in relevant game components.
   - Justify our choice of abstract classes and interfaces based on their advantages.
   - Explore scenarios for achieving multiple inheritance via interfaces.

Let's work together to create an outstanding Snake game implementation while mastering essential software development practices!

## Update: We were able to finish the Project in given timeline and it is fully functional.
